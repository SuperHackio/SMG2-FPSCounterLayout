# SMG2 FPS Display
This SMG2 mod will add a FPS Display to your game. Very useful for mod developers to make sure that the levels run at a smooth 60fps.

***Note: Dolphin doesn't emulate game lag, so this layout is useless on emulator.***

## Supported Regions
The following regions and video modes are supported:
| Region | TV Type / TV Resolution |
| :---: | -------- |
| USA | `Standard TV (480i)` <br/>`EDTV or HDTV (480p)` |
| PAL | `50Hz (576i)`<br/>`60Hz (480i)`<br/>`EDTV or HDTV (480p)` |
| JAP | `„Éó„É≠„Ç∞„É¨„ÉÉ„Ç∑„Éñ`<br/>`„Ç§„É≥„Çø„Éº„É¨„Éº„Çπ` |
| KOR | `ÌîÑÎ°úÍ∑∏Î†àÏãúÎ∏å`<br/>`Ïù∏ÌÑ∞Î†àÏù¥Ïä§` |
| TAW | `„Éó„É≠„Ç∞„É¨„ÉÉ„Ç∑„Éñ`<br/>`„Ç§„É≥„Çø„Éº„É¨„Éº„Çπ` |


## How it works
Every frame will have it's FPS calculated and displayed to your screen in the layout on the top of the screen.<br/>The background colour of the layout will change as the number of frames changes.<br/>Below is a table of what the colours mean:
| Colour Range | Frame Range<br/>(60 FPS) | Frame Range<br/>(50 FPS) | Description |
| :---: | :-----: | :---: | ---- |
| üîµ -> üü¢ | 60 - 55 | 50 - 45 | This is the perfect range. If you mod ticks inbetween here, you should be good to go. |
| üü¢ -> üü° | 55 - 50 | 45 - 40 | This is a good range. Even vanilla SMG2 drops this low at times. Your mod can drop to this range at times, but preferably as rare as possible. |
| üü° -> üî¥ | 50 - 40 | 40 - 35 | This range is rather bad. While SMG2 does appear to drop to 40 FPS at exceptional occurences, you really don't want this to happen in your mod. |
| üî¥ -> ‚ö´ | 40 - 00 | 35 - 00 | Reaching this range is an achievement in its own regard. |

### New to Version 2
- You can press (1) on the Wii Remote to show/hide the layout
- You can press (2) on the Wii Remote to change FPS Calculation modes (listed below)

FPS Calculation modes:
| Name | Icon | Description |
| --- | :-----: | ---- |
| Standard | 60<br/>59.x | To avoid flickering, there is a deadzone between 60.00 and 59.00 (50.00 and 49.00 in 50Hz). While 59.00 can still show up, anything above 59.00 will be rounded to 60.00. |
| Precise | XX<br/>.YY | Full precision is used on the display, meaning all possible values will be shown. |
| Rounded | XX<br/>‚ùå | Shows whole numbers only. |

## Supported Extensions

## Build Instructions
This mod requires **[Syati](https://github.com/SMGCommunity/Syati)**.

Clone Syati, then clone this repository. Once cloned, merge the contents of this repository into Syati's folder.</br>
If prompted to replace files, click "Yes".</br>
You also need the **CodeWarror Compiler (4.3.0.182)** and **[Kamek](https://github.com/Treeki/Kamek).**

Syati will come with some pre-made source files, you may delete those if you want (but do not delete init.cpp).

On the [Releases](https://github.com/SuperHackio/SMG2-FPSCounterLayout/releases) page, you can find a pre-compile file. This is for hacks that don't use any other Syati code (like Project Template).
