# SMG2 FPS Display
This SMG2 mod will add a FPS Display to your game. Very useful for mod developers to make sure that the levels run at a smooth 60fps.

***Note: Dolphin doesn't emulate game lag, so this layout is useless on emulator.***

## How it works
Every frame will have it's FPS calculated and displayed to your screen in the layout on the top of the screen.<br/>The background of the layout will change as the number of frames changes.<br/>Below is a table of what the colours mean:
| Colour Range | Frame Range<br/>(60 FPS) | Frame Range<br/>(50 FPS) | Description |
| :---: | :-----: | :---: | ---- |
| ðŸ”µ -> ðŸŸ¢ | 60 - 55 | 50 - 45 | This is perfect to good FPS. You can get away with a little bit of green in your mod release. |
| ðŸŸ¢ -> ðŸŸ¡ | 55 - 50 | 44 - 40 | This is good to okay FPS. You shouldn't have this in your mod. If you do, it should be as minimal as possible. |
| ðŸŸ¡ -> ðŸ”´ | 50 - 40 | 40 - 35 | This is okay to bad FPS. You shouldn't have this in your mod at all. |
| ðŸ”´ -> âš« | 40 - 00 | 35 - 00 | This is bad to forbidden FPS. Unplayable. Don't release a mod that has this. |

## Supported Extensions

## Build Instructions
This mod requires **[Syati](https://github.com/SunakazeKun/Syati)**.

Clone Syati, then clone this repository. Once cloned, merge the contents of this repository into Syati's folder.</br>
If prompted to replace files, click "Yes".</br>
You also need the **CodeWarror Compiler (4.3.0.182)** and **[Kamek](https://github.com/Treeki/Kamek).**

Syati will come with some pre-made source files, you may delete those if you want (but do not delete init.cpp).

On the [Releases](https://github.com/SuperHackio/SMG2-FPSCounterLayout/releases) page, you can find a pre-compile file. This is for hacks that don't use any other Syati code (like Project Template).

## Special Thanks
Special thanks to [Galaxy Master](https://github.com/MasterofGalaxies) for helping me figure out the math needed to calculate the FPS.
